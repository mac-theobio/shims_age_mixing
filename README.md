Data from SHIMS [[add link]]

The prevalence sample is the first sample

Incidence sample is when they went back to check on people who were HIV negative the first time
* Many variables divided into T1 and T2
* Check whether T1 matches prevalence sample (it's probably a subset)

The incidence sample has a T1/T2 structure which we should decode, if we want to use it.

For now, let's start by _just_ analyzing the prevalence sample:
* Less missing data
* We don't necessarily want to ask the same people the same question twice in six months and worry about all that
